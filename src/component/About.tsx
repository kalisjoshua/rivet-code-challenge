      <h1>...developer challenge</h1>
      <h2>Skills</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Proficient with Javascript, Typescript, React and application state
          management
        </li>
        <li>Understanding of how to consume RESTful APIs</li>
        <li>
          Working knowledge of UI/UX best practices to create an intuitive,
          usable interface
        </li>
        <li>Proficiency with CSS to style application</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        _____ has developed a RESTful API for it's employee directory. You will
        create a simple, usable, single page React application to view, add and
        update employees in this directory. The API requires an access token
        which you will be provided by email.
      </p>
      <p>Your solution should satisfy the following requirements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Allow all employee profiles to be viewed on a single screen</li>
        <li>Allow a single employee profile to be viewed</li>
        <li>Allow a new employee profile to be created</li>
        <li>Allow an existing employee profile to be updated</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Endpoints</h2>
      <p>The following endpoints have been provided to complete your task:</p>
      <p>...redacted</p>

      <h2>Profile Data Structure</h2>
      <p>Profiles have the following JSON data structure:</p>
      <p>...redacted</p>

      <h2>Deliverable</h2>
      <p>
        You will use React to create a single page application (SPA). Once
        complete, email a link to a public git repo or zipped version of your
        application (Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, etc) and provide
        instructions on how to build and run your solution to [your company
        contact].
      </p>
      <h2>Considerations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Your solution should make use of ES6 Javascript techniques such as
          promises, classes and arrow functions (where appropriate).
        </li>
        <li>
          Bonus points for using the following libraries:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/">Redux Toolkit</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://mui.com/">MUI</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Readable code will be favored over clever, confusing code.</li>
        <li>
          The optional image field only takes a URL string. If you want to add a
          profile image, you will need to figure out how to host it yourself.
        </li>
        <li>
          Get creative! Engaging micro-interactions, animations and bold design
          choices are encouraged.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Happy Coding ðŸ¤“</p>

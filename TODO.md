# Things I need to do

  [ ] refactor form fields into a component to test error messages in isolation
  [ ] make naiveSDK a singleton
  [ ] handle validation errors in the API responses
  [ ] fix error message display for "combined" fields: city, state, zip
  [ ] constrain aspect ratio of profile photo for consistency
  [ ] refactor useState in App to useReducer


## Stretch goals

  [ ] Bonus point tools: MUI, and Redux
